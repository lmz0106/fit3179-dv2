    <h1>Aussie Weather Myths: What Does the Data Really Say?</h1>
    <p>
      It’s a classic Aussie debate: Melbourne’s weather is famously unpredictable, Sydney’s is mild and pleasant, and Brisbane is the undisputed sunshine capital. But how much of this is fact, and how much is just popular myth? This visualisation dives into the daily weather data from 2024 to uncover the truth behind the stereotypes for Australia's east coast rivals.
    </p>

    <h2>The Myth of the 'Wettest' City</h2>
    <div id="vis1"></div>
    <p>
      This chart uses the Bureau of Meteorology’s definition of a rain day (≥ 1.0 mm). For 2024, Brisbane records both the most rainy days and the highest total rainfall, Sydney ranks second, and Melbourne has the fewest rainy days and lowest total rainfall among the three
    </p>

    <h2>More Than Just Hot or Cold</h2>
    <div id="vis2"></div>
    <p>
      When it comes to temperature, the story is more complex than just 'hot' or 'cold'. Hover over the cities on the map to see their average high and low temperatures for the year. This interaction reveals that the real story isn't just about averages, but about temperature consistency and range, helping to explain Melbourne's 'four seasons in one day' reputation.
    </p>

    <h2>Does Perfect Weather Mean More Visitors?</h2>
    <div id="vis3"></div>
    <p>
      Does perfect weather guarantee a tourism boom? This chart plots the number of 'pleasant days' per quarter against the number of domestic tourists. While we can see a general trend, the connection isn't as direct as one might think. This suggests that factors beyond just a sunny day play a crucial role in attracting visitors to these major cities.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
      In conclusion, the data confirms some long-held beliefs while busting others. Melbourne's weather is indeed more varied and sees more rainy days, but it is Sydney that gets the greater volume of rain. Ultimately, the story of a city's character is told in more than just its weather, as the complex relationship with tourism suggests. It seems our weather stereotypes are, much like the weather itself, not always as clear-cut as they seem.
